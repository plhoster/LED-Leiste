This Project uses an Arduino Uno with the FastLED Library which allows to adress LEDs with extremly high speeds.
In relation to the LED-Visualizer-City Project this Project uses another type of LEDs which requires a little bit of variation in terms of wiring.

Since there are only around 60 LEDs used this Project can function with just one electricity input at the Beginning of the LED-String.

In its early state the project used a Beat Recognizer but by now i actually switched to the same module that is used in the LED-Visualizer-City Project, since it outputs multiple Frequency-Channels giving more variety to the visualization.

The Souce Code uses different visualization-types which can be executed and randomly will be cycled through. These are specifically designed to fit with the String Form of the LED-Arrangement.
